## Project Summary

We are going to create a map of the United States that displays the current and past trends of the COVID-19 pandemic. The user will be able to analyze the behavior of the pandemic between different states depending on academic publications that the state is writing and releasing during a specific time period. Our website will extract data from these academic publications and display keywords and trends in an effort to understand the public response. In addition, the user will be able to see the contamination trends by observing how many people are testing positive and negative in each respective state. With these two sets of data/information the user can accurately understand the public understanding and response to the pandemic.
